# ps-rmd-plugin

A prototype of a responsive metadata plugin for Adobe Photoshop.

The plugin supports the [RMD standard](https://github.com/universalimages/rmd) 
promoted by the [W3C Universal Image Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/universalimages/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sbaechler/ps-rmd-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sbaechler/ps-rmd-plugin)

## Installation

The plugin only supports Photoshop CC and is therefore best installed via the Creative Cloud.
It is currently under review and not yet publicly available.

You can download the binary build from the Github release page and install it yourself.
Rename the file to `universalimages.zip` and extract it. (Use the unarchiver on Mac.)
Copy the folder to `~/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`. Create the folder if it 
doens't exist.
